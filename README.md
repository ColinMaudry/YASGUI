# Forked YASGUI 1.0.0

The purpose of this fork is to get a working YASGUI, a public SPARQL query editor to query the data [extracted from data.gouv.fr](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/datagouvfr-rdf). But removing the [YASGUI documentation](http://yasgui.org). And adding query examples.

The result is online:

* [In English](http://www.data.maudry.com/query/en.html)
* [En fran√ßais](http://www.data.maudry.com/query/fr.html)
